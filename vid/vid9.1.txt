Remember when you were a child and everything seemed possible?
Ex-NASA scientist Dr. Rivers leaked a breakthrough after studying thousands of rich, lucky, and creative individuals.
He revealed that a specific brainwave, active in childhood,
holds the key to unlock creative genius, and the ability to attract what we desire.
But why aren't most of us a genius after growing up? Why?

Because as we get older and molded into society's standards,
brain-numbing jobs exhaust our motivation and fulfillment.
Endless trash TV and shallow music rot our brains.
This shuts down the brainwave that once gave us genius abilities,
robbing us of the mental power to attract wealth, health, and fulfilling relationships
that could have easily been ours.

The great news is, this discovery has led to a unique at-home 7-second brain hack,
allowing the dormant brain areas to reconnect, unleashing the God given brain power.
